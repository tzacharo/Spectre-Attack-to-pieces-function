# Spectre-Attack-to-pieces-function-
'''
Specter which is structured in many different functions. In order to be 
divided into several pieces and not be close (in line spacing) within a 
program so that it is even more difficult to locate it. Then somehow 
(e.g. buffer overflow) trigger the chain reaction that will start the 
attack.
The code is based on Spectre V1 from
